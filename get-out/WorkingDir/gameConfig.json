		"gameEndMessage": "\n\nAs you remove the heavy triple lock from the door, you can hear footsteps on the other side.\nYou quickly open the door and are blinded by a very bright white light.\nWhile trying to adjust to the extreme lighting, you feel a needle in your neck.\nAs you fall down to the ground, fainting, you hear a rather high-pitched voice saying:\n'THE EXIT IS A LIE'.\n\n...\n\nWell, you finished the game.\nIt's probably not the ending you expected, but at least you have some closure now.",
